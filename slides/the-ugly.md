##  The Ugly

- if formly does not do what you need, you need to fork
  - forking makes updates hard
  - instead try to contribute
- cannot get the event when form has been rendered
  - initial render can take long
- with large forms rendering is slow
  - initial render is slow, after that form is responsive
