##  The Ugly

- If formly does not do what you need, you need to fork
  - Forking makes updates hard
  - Instead try to contribute
- Cannot get the event when form has been rendered
  - Initial render can take long
- With large forms rendering is slow
  - Initial render is slow, after that form is responsive
