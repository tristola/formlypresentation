##  The bad

- Performance is a factor for very large forms
  - After over 1000 lines of json, performance will suffer
- Hard to find bottlenecks in the performance
- Limits the form UI
  - some things become hard to implement
  - others impossible
- I have been using versions 1.0 -> 3.2.7
 - latest is 7.2.1
